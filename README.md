   - Real data set:  data set contains PRSs for psychotic-like experiences (PLE) measured on 227 healthy individuals. PLE are similar psychotic experiences to those experienced by patients with schizophrenia but found in an attenuated form in healthy subjects. PLE are considered to be normally distributed in the general population, with just a few individuals presenting high levels of PLE and thus being the ones at risk of developing psychosis.
