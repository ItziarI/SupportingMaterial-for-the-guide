Supported Information of the tutorial paper *A guide to test association between Polygenic Risk Scores and psychological and psychiatric traits: practical examples* can be reproduced with the provided material in the repository

Included material is: 
 
**Codes in the examples and corresponding R codes**
   - Sinthetics: 
   
       - WExample1.csv and WorkingExample1_code.Rmd
       - WExample2.csv and WorkingExample2_code.Rmd
       - WExample3.csv and WorkingExample3_code.Rmd
       - WExample4.csv and WorkingExample4_code.Rmd
   
   - Real data set: 
   
   Data set contains PRSs for psychotic-like experiences (PLE) measured on 227 healthy individuals. PLE are similar psychotic experiences to those experienced by patients with schizophrenia but found in an attenuated form in healthy subjects. PLE are considered to be normally distributed in the general population, with just a few individuals presenting high levels of PLE and thus being the ones at risk of developing psychosis.

      - Real_data_Positive.csv with codes Real_dataCAPE_Positive_code.Rmd
   
   

 
 **To run the examples**
 
   Once all files are download, each .Rmd file can be executed/knitted in R and an *html* file with the corresponding results is generated.
   
   Nevertheless, for the reader that do not want to execute the code and ease the reading of the tutorial, the final html files are also included.
